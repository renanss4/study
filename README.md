## About the Guessing Game

The guessing game is a simple game where the computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess it through trial and error. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is greater or less than the target number. The player can continue guessing until they correctly guess the number or choose to quit the game.
